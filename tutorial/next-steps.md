# Next Steps

This concludes the tutorial, hopefully it's given you a basic outline of what fabrikk can do. I very much encourage writing a few of your own factories and playing around with them to really grok it.

Things you may want to do now:

* Check out the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")section for some more advanced capabilities
* Read the [api.md](../reference/api.md "mention") reference
* Read more about the [directives.md](../reference/directives.md "mention") that fabrikk provides
