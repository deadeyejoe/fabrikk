# Next Steps

This concludes the tutorial, hopefully it's given you a basic outline of what Fabrikk can do. I very much encourage writing a few of your own factories and playing around with them to really grok it.

Things you may want to do now:

* Read more about the [concepts.md](../reference/concepts.md "mention") mentioned in this tutorial
* Read the [api.md](../reference/api.md "mention") reference
